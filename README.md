# Project 1

Project 1 was first created almost a year ago by me. The project was extremely simple, but useful as well. Everyone needs a calculator, no? 


## Important things to explain

- Give info on my particular choice in code.
- Give the viewer info on Python.
- Allow the viewer to see the output of the code.
- Explain how it works without unnecessary filler.
