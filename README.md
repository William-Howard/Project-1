# Project 1

Project 1 was first created almost a year ago by me. The project was extremely simple, but useful as well. Everyone needs a calculator, no? Python was the language in which
it was created with. 


## Interesting things to know about Python before we start.

- Python is a software that has C and Java variants.
- It's used commonly by people who are just starting to learn about coding. 
- Believe it or not, Python has overtaken French as one of the most popular languages taught in schools. 
- It does not require a compiler.
- Python is an open source language.
- It is also one of the official languages of Google. 

# What is the purpose of Project 1?

The purpose of Project 1 was to simply make a calculator that could allow one to figure out the area and perimeter of a rectangle, while also allowing one to calculate the 
area and volume of a cylinder. In order for one to figure out these calculations, you would have to know the:
- Area of a Rectangle
- Perimeter of a Rectangle 
- Area of a Cylinder
- Volume of a Cylinder

# How did you do make this exactly? 

**1.** When you first open up the Python module, it is important to first import "from math import pi". By doing this, we are able to import the necessary tools to help find the 
partcicular equations and symbols for the math problem.
