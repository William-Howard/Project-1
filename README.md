# Project 1

Project 1 was first created almost a year ago by me. The project was extremely simple, but useful as well. Everyone needs a calculator, no? Python was the language in which
it was created with. 


## Interesting things to know about Python before we start.

- Python is a software that has C and Java variants.
- It's used commonly by people who are just starting to learn about coding. 
- Believe it or not, Python has overtaken French as one of the most popular languages taught in schools. 
- It does not require a compiler.
- Python is an open source language.
- It is also one of the official languages of Google. 

# What is the purpose of Project 1?

The purpose of Project 1 was to simply make a calculator that could allow one to figure out the area and perimeter of a rectangle, while also allowing one to calculate the 
area and volume of a cylinder. In order for one to figure out these calculations, you would have to know the:
- Area of a Rectangle
- Perimeter of a Rectangle 
- Area of a Cylinder
- Volume of a Cylinder

# How did you do make this exactly? 

**1.** When you first open up the Python module, it is important to import 'from math import pi'. By doing this, we are able to import the necessary tools to help create the 
partcicular equations and symbols for the math problems. 
(ex. from math import pi)

**2.** After you import Pi, you then should find simple letters that will be included in the later equations. It's important that these letters or numbers are not 
similar, so as to avoid confusion. 
(ex. h,w,r,ch)

**3.** After you have decided your simple inputs, you will then ask the person at the keyboard to "enter the rectangles height/width" and "enter the cylinders radius/height".
This would allow the output to actaully ask you what the height and width of a traingle is, while also askng about the radius and height of a cylinder.
(ex. h=int(input("Enter the rectangle height : "))

**4.** Once your inputs have been created, you will need to then type in the equations for your final outputs. These equations would consist of the rectangle area, rectangle
perimeter, cylinder area, and the cylinder volume. 
(ex. rectangle_area = width * height)

**5.** After the equations are done, you will then need to 'print' your outputs in order to actually see them. At the start of your line you'll write print, immediately
allowing your final outputs to be....put out. You'll then have to plug in the particular measurement you are looking for. 
(ex. print(rectangle_area))
