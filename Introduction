Hello there. My name is William Howard, and I am glad to see you took the time to look at my Github. 

Project 1 is a very simple piece of code I did in my first semester of college. The code itself is a simple math calculator that finds the area of a rectangle,
the rectangle width, the area of a cylinder, and the volume of a cylinder. This was found by being able to input the rectangle height, the rectangle width,
the cylinder radius, and the cylinder height. This input would, of course, come from the person at the keyboard. 

It's not much, but the language itself was from Python, the software I used during my first semester. This was the very first software I touched, and I have grown 
somewhat accustomed to the language. Though the code is simple, I like to think that the most simple of codes still have the most use. It's easy to say that I should
be showing you a fantastically complex piece of code, but this just seemed more appropriate for an introduction.
